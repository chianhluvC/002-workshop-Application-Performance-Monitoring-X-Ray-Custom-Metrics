#### Cost Analysis

1. Overview of cost-generating components

| **Service**                   | **Billed by**                                         | **Estimated Monthly Cost (e.g., 100k requests)**   |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **AWS Lambda**               | Number of requests + execution time (GB-seconds)      | ~ $2–$5                                            |
| **AWS X-Ray**                | Number of trace segments (measured per invoke)        | ~ $2.50 / 1 million trace segments                 |
| **CloudWatch Logs**          | GB of stored logs + log event ingestion               | ~ $0.50–$1 / GB                                    |
| **CloudWatch Custom Metrics**| $0.30 / metric / month (after first 10 free metrics)  | ~ $0.60 for 2 metrics                              |
| **CloudWatch Alarms**        | $0.10 / alarm / month                                 | ~ $0.10–$0.50                                      |
| **SNS (email alerts)**       | Free for email (SMTP)                                 | $0                                                 |

2. Cost breakdown based on implemented solution

| **Component**                 | **Notes**                                                              | **Cost**                     |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Lambda MonitorFunction**   | 100,000 invocations/month, avg duration 600ms, 128MB RAM               | ≈ $2.50                      |
| **X-Ray**                    | One trace per invoke (100k trace segments)                             | ≈ $2.50                      |
| **CloudWatch Logs**          | Logs for latency + EMF custom metrics                                  | ≈ $1–$2 (depends on log volume / JSON size) |
| **Custom Metrics: ProcessingTime** | Written in EMF format → billed per metric name               | ~$0.30–$0.60                |
| **Alarm CloudWatch + SNS**   | One alarm, one email topic                                             | ~$0.10                      |
| **Estimated total / month**  |                                                                        | **~ $6–$8.50 / month**       |

3. Cost optimization strategies

| **Issue**                                 | **Optimization Suggestion**                                                     |
|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **High X-Ray cost**                       | Enable tracing only for critical Lambdas (sampling rate 10–20%)                |
| **Too many logs**                         | Use log level filters (e.g., log latency only if > 500ms)                      |
| **Expensive custom metrics**              | Combine multiple metrics into one EMF log if possible                          |
| **Logs stored for too long**              | Set Log Group Retention to 7 or 14 days                                        |
| **Too many frequent CloudWatch queries**  | Create summary dashboards instead of running ad-hoc queries                    |
| **High Lambda GB-seconds usage**          | Reduce timeout or memory where unnecessary                                     |

4. Use AWS tools to analyze cost

- **AWS Cost Explorer**  
  - Filter by service: Lambda, CloudWatch, X-Ray  
  - View by time or specific resources  

- **AWS CloudWatch Billing Alerts**  
  - Create alarms when total cost exceeds threshold  

- **X-Ray + CloudWatch Metrics**  
  - Analyze which specific requests are expensive (slow traces → high GB-seconds)  

- **Lambda Tags**  
  - Tag functions by `cost-center`, `env`, etc., for better cost classification  

Based on tools like AWS Cost Explorer and metrics from X-Ray & CloudWatch, the system currently costs around **$6–$9/month** for 100,000 requests. Most costs come from Lambda execution, X-Ray tracing, and CloudWatch logs/metrics. Optimization measures include adjusting sampling rates, reducing log size, shortening log retention periods, and consolidating metrics.

#### Optimization Recommendations

| **Observation from X-Ray & CloudWatch**           | **Suggested Optimization**                                                                 |
|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ⏱️ Average latency > 600ms                        | 🔁 Use caching to reduce processing time — e.g., cache DB/API results via Redis or S3       |
| 🚀 Random latency spikes (800–1000ms)             | 📦 Increase memory (CPU scales with RAM) — try 256MB or 512MB instead of 128MB              |
| 📉 High ProcessingTime variability                | 🔄 Offload heavy tasks to async processing — e.g., logging/email → SNS or SQS + Lambda     |
| 🔁 Frequent repeated Lambda invocations           | ⛔ Add throttling or deduplication at the API caller side                                   |
| 📊 Stable metrics but slow response               | ⚙️ Investigate external dependencies (e.g., slow APIs, RDS, network latency...) via traces |
| 📉 Long "Initialization" time                     | 🛠️ Reduce cold starts — keep warm or avoid large global variables outside handler          |

There are many ways to optimize your system. One highly effective method is to trigger automatic resource scaling upon alerts — such as increasing memory when latency thresholds are breached, helping your app perform more reliably and efficiently.
